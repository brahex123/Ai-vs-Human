# 🧠 Ai-vs-Human – Detecting AI-Generated Text

This repository explores the task of distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated texts using various machine learning models. The project was developed as part of a text classification challenge focused on binary classification (0 = Human, 1 = AI).

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Classify whether a given text is written by a human or generated by an AI (e.g., LLM).
- **Approach**: Evaluate and compare multiple models:
  - Logistic Regression (baseline)
  - Neural Network (MLP)
  - XGBoost (tree-based boosting)

## 🧪 Models Used

- **Logistic Regression**: Used as a baseline linear model.
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**: Fully connected neural network for nonlinear classification.
- **XGBoost Classifier**: Gradient boosting framework for high-performance classification.

All models were trained and evaluated using basic text features (TF-IDF) on the training set. Final submissions include predictions on the test set.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/brahex123/Ai-vs-Human.git
cd Ai-vs-Human
```

2. Open the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Detecte_Ai.ipynb
```

---

## 📊 Sample Prediction Format

Each submission CSV (e.g., `completed_submission_nn.csv`) includes:
```
Id,Category
710,0
487,0
136,1
...
```

- `Id`: Corresponds to the row index in the test set
- `Category`: Predicted label (0 = Human, 1 = AI)

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

Models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
